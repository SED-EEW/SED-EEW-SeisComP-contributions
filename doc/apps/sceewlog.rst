Part of the :ref:`EEW<EEW>` package (used by :ref:`VS<VS>` and :ref:`FinDer<FINDER>`).

*sceewlog*  logs the VS and FinDer magnitude messages received from :ref:`scvsmag` and 
:ref:`scfinder` (configurable), broadcasts these alerts, and triggers scripts, generates 
and disseminates reports.

*sceewlog* is released under the GNU Affero General Public License (Free
Software Foundation, version 3 or later). It requires the Python package
`dateutil`_ to be installed. sceewlog replaces scvslog that was originally 
part of the SeisComP implementation of the `Virtual Seismologist`_ (VS) 
Earthquake Early Warning algorithm.

Once an event has timed out, the modules generates report files. These report 
files are saved to disk and can also be sent via email.

It also implements `ActiveMQ`_ and `Firebase Cloud Messaging`_ interfaces which can
send alert messages in real-time. It supports regionalized filter profiles (based on 
polygons and EQ parameter threshold values). Currently, messages can be sent in four 
different formats (*sc3ml*, *qml1.2-rt*, *shakealertml* the UserDisplay format, *CAP1.2*). 
Optionally, a comment with ID **EEW** storing the EEW update number, can be added to 
each magnitude that passes all configured filters and scoring.

The SED-ETHZ team provides a client that can display *qml1.2-rt* messages sent via 
ActiveMQ, the `Earthquake Early Warning Display (EEWD)`_ an OpenSource user interface 
developed within the European REAKT project and based on early versions of the ShakeAlert 
`UserDisplay`_. 

To receive alerts with the EEWD set the format to *qml1.2-rt*. There are
currently no clients which can digest *sc3ml* and the *shakealertml* is not 
supported. Using pipelines alerts can be sent out in more than one format.

The real-time ActiveMQ interface requires the Python packages 
`stompy`_ and `lxml`_ to be installed.

It is beyond the scope of this documentation to explain the complete setup of an
ActiveMQ broker. However, since sceewlog uses the STOMP protocol to send
messages to the broker it is essential to add the following line
to configuration of the ActiveMQ broker.

.. code-block:: sh

   <connector>
   <serverTransport uri="stomp://your-server-name:your-port"/>
   </connector>

Please refer to `ActiveMQ`_ for setting up an ActiveMQ broker.


Firebase Cloud Messaging
========================
EEW messages are controlled by the parameters Magnitude Association and Regionalized Profiles. Notifications are sent using the `HTTP v1`_ and it requires the following python libraries:

.. code-block:: sh
   
   google
   requests
   google-auth-oauthlib
   firebase-admin

Further information on the Firebase Cloud Messaging interface can be found in `Firebase Cloud Messaging`_. This interface is activated in the module configuration file with the option:

.. code-block:: sh

   FCM.activate = true

In addition, the configuration file defined in FCM.dataFile provides the firebase configuration. It includes the path to a service JSON (see the Firebase project console `Service JSON File`_), the broadcasted topic (notification topic), the project ID string (see `Project ID`_), and it controls (enable or disable) notification to Android, iOS and a legacy notification format.
Below is an example how this file, referenced in the *FCM.dataFile*, looks like:

.. code-block:: python 
   
   [TOPICS]
   topic=eqAlerts
   [SERVICEFILE]
   servicefile= /opt/fcm/credentials/projectServiceFile.json
   [PROJECTID]
   projectid = myappid
   [ENABLED_OS]
   android = true
   ios = true
   [SUPPORT_OLD_FORMAT]
   oldformat = true

*Creation time* is the time the VS magnitude message was generated, *tdiff* is
the time difference between *creation time* and last *origin time* in seconds,
*lik.* is the likelihood that this event is a real event (see documentation of
:ref:`scvsmag`), *#St.(Or.)* is the number of stations that contributed to the
origin and  *#St.(Ma.)* the number of envelope streams that contributed to the
magnitude. *Str.* and *Len.* are the strike and length of the fault line
provided by :ref:`scfinder`.

Regionalized Filters
====================

To filter alerts to be sent out through ActiveMQ or FCM, it is necessary to set 
profiles on RegFilters section. Since this is using regions defined as closed 
polygons, then the first step is to provide a BNA file that contains the 
polygons. If the user does not provide a BNA file, then the other profile 
parameters will be evaluated globally.

.. code-block:: sh

   RegFilters.bnaFile = /opt/seiscomp/share/sceewlog/closedpolygons.bna
   
Then profile names have to be set. Two profile examples are provided below.

.. code-block:: sh

   RegFilters.profiles = global, America
   
The **global** profile is not configured with polygon since this spans on the 
entire world. The **America** profile uses the "America" closed polygon defined 
in :confval:`activeMQ.bnaFile`.

.. code-block:: sh

   RegFilters.profile.global.bnaPolygonName = none
   RegFilters.profile.America.bnaPolygonName = America

The magnitude and likelihood threshold values might be:

.. code-block:: sh

   RegFilters.profile.global.magThresh = 6.0
   RegFilters.profile.global.likelihoodThresh = 0.5
   RegFilters.profile.America.magThresh = 5.0
   RegFilters.profile.America.likelihoodThresh = 0.3

There might also be a depth filter for each profile. The following parameters 
might be used to configure the **global** profile with shallow events, and 
the **America** profile with events from 0 to 100 km deep.

.. code-block:: sh

   RegFilters.profile.global.minDepth = 0
   RegFilters.profile.global.maxDepth = 33
   RegFilters.profile.America.minDepth = 0
   RegFilters.profile.America.maxDepth = 100

Finally, to avoid sending alerts for events outside of the network of interest 
for EEW applications, a :confval:`maxTime` can be set. The :confval:`maxTime` 
is the maximum delay in seconds between the magnitude creation time since the 
origin time. For the examples, on the **global** profile this parameter might 
be "-1" in order to skip this filter, whereas it could be set to 60 seconds for 
**America**. However, each of the :ref:`VS` and :ref:`FinDer` algorithms have 
their own default thresholds superseding :confval:`maxTime` defined in 
:ref:`sceewlog`.

.. code-block:: sh

   RegFilters.profile.global.maxTime = -1
   RegFilters.profile.America.maxTime = 60


Magnitude Association
=====================
The magnitude association is similar than the :ref:`scevent` 
preferred-origin selection. The magnitude association evaluation is activated 
with the next configuration key-value pair:

.. code-block:: sh
   
   magAssociation.activate = true
  
The following priorities are available:

1. typeThresh
2. likelihood
3. Authors
4. StationMagNumber

and they can be listed on the next key-value:

.. code-block:: sh
  
   magAssociation.priority = magThresh,likelihood,authors,stationMagNumber

The priority decreases in the order of the parameters.

The *magThresh* prority is a list of minimal magnitude to be allowed for each type of magnitude:

.. code-block:: sh
   
   magAssociation.typeThresh = Mfd:6.0,MVS:3.5,Mlv:2.5

For one specific update of an event, its magnitude type-value must be equal or higher than the listed ones to continue the evaluation. Otherwise, the evaluation ends and the evalution does not continue.

The authors can be also used and their priority depends on the position on which they are listed. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   #if magAssociation.priority contains authors then
   #the next parameter must contain valid magnitude authors' names
   magAssociation.authors = scvsmag@@@hostname@, \
   scvsmag0@@@hostname@, \
   scfd85sym@@@hostname@, \
   scfd20asym@@@hostname@, \
   scfdcrust@@@hostname@

In this list of authors the highest value is for *scvsmag* and for this particular example this author has a value of 5. The author value reduces after each comma separator. For the same example *scvsmag0* is 4, *scfd85sym* is 3, and so. The author is evaluated for every event update. If the author for a particular update has a higher o equal priority than an already evaluated and sent alert, then the evaluation continues, otherwise, whether the author is listed or not, the evaluation ends.

If likelihood is listed on priorities then this is evaluated against with a previous update that has been sent out as alert. Only when there is a first event update the likelihood is not evaluated. In case that an update has been sent out as an alert, if the current likelihood is higher or equal than the previous one, then it goes to the next priority evaluation, otherwise, the update is discarted.

For the *stationMagNumber* evaluation is necessary to have a similar list of Magtype and min number of stations used to quantify the magnitude value. For example:

.. code-block:: sh
   
   magAssociation.stationMagNumber = Mfd:7,MVS:4

In this example for the mag type *Mfd* is necessary to at least have 7 stations to pass this evaluation, otherwise, the evaluation ends. For *MVS* must be at least 4 stations that have been used to qunatify the magnitude, otherwise, the valution ends.


Headline Change for CAP1.2 XML alerts
=====================================

The converted CAP1.2 xml alert messages contain a headline. The default headline is: 

.. code-block:: sh
   
   @AGENCY@ Magnitude X.X Date and Time (UTC): YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:s.sssZ.

An alternative headline format might be preferred. The following alternative 
format can be selected:

.. code-block:: sh
   
   @AGENCY@/Earthquake Magnitude X.X, XX km NNW of SOMECITY, SOMECOUNTRY

The aternative format supports both spanish and english languages. The 
spanish version is:
 
.. code-block:: sh
   
   @AGENCY@/Sismo Magnitud X.X, XX km al SSO de SOMECITY, SOMECOUNTRY

The alternative format can be enable as follows:

.. code-block:: sh
   
   CAPheadlineChange = true

The alternative format requires to specify the language and the corresponding 
file listing the world cities :confval:`CitiesFile`. The language
can be selected as follows:

.. code-block:: sh
  
   #Uncomment the next line to select English
   AlertTextLanguage = en-US
   #Uncomment the next line to select Spanish
   #AlertTextLanguage = es-US

The file listing the world cities :confval:`CitiesFile` must have 
the following format:

.. code-block:: sh
  
   city,country,lon,lat
   Tokyo,Japan,139.6922,35.6897
   Jakarta,Indonesia,106.8451,-6.2146
   Delhi,India,77.23,28.66
   Mumbai,India,72.8333,18.9667
   Manila,Philippines,120.9833,14.6
   Shanghai,China,121.4667,31.1667
   Sao Paulo,Brazil,-46.6339,-23.5504

Both an english and a spanish version are provided in "@DATADIR@/sceewlog/world_cities_english.csv"
and "@DATADIR@/sceewlog/world_cities_spanish.csv".
